# IRP_log

### Week 14

#### Idea

1. A center node, not as a sensor, as a server to send control info to each sensor node, and also collect info, this node should be python based or a node to communicate with outside python script(ML)
2. Using 6p function to realise dynamic control of scheduling table.

### Week 15

#### Idea

1. Use GNN network for further ML part.

2. Use config file to config the behaviour of the nodes in the network to improve complexity of network.

3. Pre-define some serneos or some modes of the networks, such as high latency, high load, or lossy or other somethings.
